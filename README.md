# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to the **Advent of Code** repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December, where each day a new programming puzzle is released.

## Structure

Each year's solutions are contained within their own directory, named `YYYY`, where `YYYY` is the year (e.g., `2024` for the year 2024). Inside each year's directory, each day's solution is contained within its own subdirectory, named `DayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01` for December 1st), and inside each day's directory, you will find `main.py`, which is my solution to the puzzle written in Python.

The puzzle descriptions and input files can be found on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

<!-- ## How to Run

To run the solutions, you will need Python installed on your machine. Navigate to the directory of the year and day you want to run and execute the solution script:

```bash
cd YYYY/dayXX
python solution.py
```
