# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to the **Advent of Code** repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December, where each day a new programming puzzle is released.

## Structure

Each year's solutions are contained within their own directory, named `YYYY`, where `YYYY` is the year (e.g., `2024` for the year 2024). Inside each year's directory, each day's solution is contained within its own subdirectory, named `DayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `Day01` for December 1st), and inside each day's directory, you will find `main.py`, which is my solution to the puzzle written in Python.

The puzzle descriptions and input files can be found on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).
